# BookReccomender
Embeddings based book reccomender


This project aims to create a book reccommendation engine by creating an embedding space with a sizeable amount of descriptions within it, and allow a reader to suggest a book, or books, that they enjoy, and find books near that vector in the space.

The primary challenges we need to overcome is ensuring that different descriptions maintain logic in their embeddings, or finding a way to standardize these descriptions. Once this is accomplished, we need a way to get descriptions from user added books in a cheap manner, that continues to maintain the embedding space's logic.

Once the engine is built, we aim to add user tools, including multiple books, links to purchasing, the ability to indicate a preferred site, and finally hopefully go from a genre or description of a book into reccomendations, instead of existent books.
